# YouTube â†’ MIDI for Noobs

A collection of scripts for interacting with Google's [MT3 multi-track MIDI transcription model](https://github.com/magenta/mt3).

I had a lot of fun playing with this model, and wanted to make a more accessible demo for the people... you people!
Thus, the notebooks in this repo skip the audio upload and allows direct transcription from YouTube.

## How to use
Open one of the following Colab notebooks with your Google account.
